# Neurosymbolic Tutorial

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neurosymbolic-learning/Neurosymbolic_Summer_School)

This is the material used in the [Neurosymbolic Summer School 2022](http://www.neurosymbolic.org/summerschool.html) and for the [NeurIPS 2022 tutorial on Neurosymbolic Programming](https://sites.google.com/view/nsptutorial). The goal of the notebooks is to provide a hands-on component (30 min each) to complement the tutorials. We provide code as an initial walk-through of baseline methods grounded in [behavior analysis applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02710.pdf), with optional exercises for open-ended exploration. The dataset consists of thousands of frames of trajectory data annotated with behavior labels by domain experts. The notebooks demonstrate neurosymbolic programming for behavior quantification, where the task is to learn the relationship between pose and behavior. 

## Setup

You will need Google Colab and a directory to access `code_and_data` from Colab. The data can be downloaded from this public Google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TS9DPhtpe4oSjA3TJ65niHU7ICNCPXXj?usp=sharing to be placed inside `code_and_data/data`. For example, the current code assumes the training data is in the path `code_and_data/data/calms21_task1/train_data.npy`.

## Notebook 1 

The goal of this notebook is to provide a walk-through of the data with example code for training neural networks and programs.
